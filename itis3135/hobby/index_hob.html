        <h2>What is Dirt Biking?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Dirt biking is an adrenaline-fueled motorsport that involves riding lightweight, off-road motorcycles, known as dirt bikes across rugged terrain. 
            These bikes are specifically designed with high suspension, off road tires, and powerful engines to handle dirt trails, mud, sand, and rocky paths. </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> Biking can take various forms, including motocross which is racing on closed circuits with jumps and obstacles, enduro which is long-distance off-road riding through natural terrain, 
            and freestyle motocross (performing aerial tricks and stunts). Riders wear protective gear such as helmets, 
            goggles, gloves, and body armor to ensure safety while navigating challenging courses.
        </p>

    <section id="About_me">
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p class="paragraph"> I am a Sophomore in college at UNC Charlotte. Currently I am studying computer science, but that is not why you really came to this page is it</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> Recieved my dirt bike as a present in 2020 as a gift from my dad. My dirt bike is a Honda 2021 CRF250F that I love with all my heart. I mainly ride trails all over North 
            Carolina and Virginia. I have been to many different trails such as Brown Mountain, Uwharrie, and the mountains of Virginia.
            I have been on many different trails and have had many different experiences. I have met some of my closest friends through this hobby and it is something that I will always cherish.

    <section id="Best_times">
        <h2>Best times</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">The best time to go dirt biking is during the spring and fall seasons when the weather is mild and the trails are not too muddy or dusty. 
            Riding in the early morning or late afternoon can provide cooler temperatures and beautiful sunrises or sunsets. 
            It's also best to check the weather forecast and trail conditions before heading out to ensure a memorable and enjoyable ride.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">When achieving the pro level of dirt biking, you can ride in any weather condition and still have a great time. 
            But that is not me, I am still learning and trying to get better at riding my dirt bike.
