            <li><strong>Personal Background</strong>: Hi my name is Kenton (Kenny) and iâ€™m 20 years old.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Academic background</strong>:  Second year computer science student.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Background in this subject</strong>:  I have minimal experience in the subject other than browsing the inspect element.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform</strong>:  Laptop/Windows.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Courses i'm taking and why</strong>:</li>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Calculus</strong>- I have to take it unfortunately.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Criminal Justice</strong>- I want to eventually make my way into either the practical/legal side of cyber security and so I want to learn more about the legal system.
                </li>
                <li><strong>CTCM 2530</strong>- While this class does focus on comedy, it also teaches us to think critically about everything around us. Going further both in life and computer science, critical thinking is an absolute must.
                </li>
                <li><strong>ITIS 3135</strong>- As mentioned above, I want to become a cybersecurity professional and a large part of cybersecurity comes with web vulnerabilities. I must know how to create and modify a website if I'm going to defend it.
                </li>
                <li><strong>ITCS 3160</strong>- This class is database design and implementation class and again working in cybersecurity can mean working with databases.
                </li>
                <li><strong>METR 1102</strong>- This is meteorology and I needed a science without a lab so here I am.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Funny/Interesting item about yourself</strong>: I like to snowboard, do motocross, fish, game, and read.
            </li>
