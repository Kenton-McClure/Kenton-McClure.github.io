        <p>Here are some evaluations of the websites:</p>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.luxurycruisetickets.com/">luxurycruisetickets.com</a></h3>
            <p>This site allows you to purchase luxury cruise tickets to various places around the world. The beginning of the site starts by showing a picturesque view of
                one of the cruise liners.  </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: The white background with accents of white allow the colors to really blend well together</li>
                <li>Repition: The webiste stays consistent with the scrolling left and right motions with different locations/destinations</li>
                <li>Alignment: While the sliders do start in somewhat of an odd position, but everything else seems to be nicely centered</li>
                <li>Proximity: The dividers in between each one of the sliders appears to be equally centered</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While there are some design elements of the sliders could use some adjusting to not have them start in the middle, they still fit nicely on the page. Overall the site
                is not overly cluttered and is easy to navigate. The colors are nice and the images are
                beautiful. The site is easy to navigate and the information is clear and concise.</p>
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://userinyerface.com/">User Inyerface</a></h3>
            <p>this is a very short webiste that manages to do so much wrong. Truly impressive.</p>
            <figure>

            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Honestly the contrast is the least of worry on this page. However it still manages to look horrible with green on blue</li>
                <li>Repition: The font stays somewhat consistent at least. With that being said it is still bland and plain</li>
                <li>Alignment: The alignment is the one thing they get right on this page since they just centered everything</li>
                <li>Proximity: The proximity is not bad since there isn't really anything on the screen but there are buttons that make no sense</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall this site is a mess. The colors are horrible and the buttons make no sense. The site is not easy to navigate and the information is not clear or concise. The
                design is cluttered. I would not recommend this site to anyone.</p>
